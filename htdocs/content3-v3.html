			Oh! are interseted in video games well if you are you are at the right place.
			When it comes to games there are quite a lot of types bu here i would like to
			focus on two, PC games and mobile games, as these are waht i am most acquainted
			with.
			<br>
			<br>
			To most of the gaming community, mobile games are seen as bad as most of them
			are full of ads and are just used to gain money from kids using their parent's
			phone and purchase things using the credit card but there also some amazing ones
			mobile(in my opinion). If you want to play a quiet game I reccomend minecraft 
			beacuse while being quite it has a multiplayer mode which is quite intense 
			<br>
			<br>
			PC games I have only played quite a few pc games as my laptop cannot handle them
			well, but the ones I played are(in my opinion) quite good. The one I would 
			reccomend if you have a low spec device is brawlhalla as it does not need much.
			If you have a decent device I would reccomend some FPS like valorant.
